The following data set is licensed in the public domain.

Project Objective:
The primary goal of this analysis is to determine how much the US has contricuted to CO2 emissions in comparision to other countries and find out which time period CO2 emissions were at their highest in the US.  
Upon initial analysis of the data, it appears that the information provided may be unreliable as Wikipedia is listed as a secondary source for the information. Wikipedia is widely know to be an untrustworthy site to gather information because it is a user-gernerated source. However, the data set lists that it primarily retrieved data from the official World Health Organization site, which is globally recognized. The data file appears to be very redundant, as CO2 emissions remain static for several years at a ttime, but after analyzing the data further and charting the data in a more human-readable way, it is evident that these redundant data points reveal trends in CO2 emissions.
